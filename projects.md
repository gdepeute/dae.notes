  - goals: WMS feature improvements, layer monitoring improvements, ...
  - yields: more robust and stable end user experience
- IAEA Phase 2 - Custom Reports (2 man months)
  - goals: custom reports for IAEA, leveraged/customized for customers like Mercedes Benz and others, adds Air Quality to Wildfire Repors
  - yields: much improved and more informational wildfire reports
- IAEA Phase 3 - Custom Reports (2 man months)
  - goals: adds floods, volcanic eruptions, ...
  - yields: additional custom reports which can be upsold to customers
- DASv4 for DA (1 man month)
  - goals: migrate last holdout to new notifications system
  - yields: cost savings, unified notifications across all installations
- Organizations Improvement (1-2 man months)
  - goals: improve organizations component to make it easier to manage/add/change users, ultimately end user admin facing
  - yields: reduces current support burden, paves the way for large customer installations to be self-service
- Private Instance improvements (2 man months)
  - goals: streamline and optimize private instance deployment flow, dramatically reduce time, brings deployment time down to hours from days
  - yields: dramatic speedup to on-boarding, will enable more customized trials when we can bring up/down the private instances quickly
- API improvements (2 man months)
  - goals: add historical hazards data, and layers data to the DaaS API
  - yields: more data to sell, thus more ARR

- Web Hook Notification Support (1 man month)
  - goals: allows integration of notifications (hazard specific and/or asset/hazard specific) into other systems which support webhooks.
  - yields: as many systems support incoming data via webhooks, this opens up many more integrations
- Streaming Hazards API (1 man month)
  - goals: add streaming endpoint for active hazards to API as alternative to polling
  - yields: more efficient way to receive data, assures no data is missed/lost, and delivers data in real time
- Data Improvements (3-6 man months)
  - goals: continual improvements and addition of data to the existing hazards/incidents, addition of impact data, hazard evolution, better description/geometries leveraging ML models
  - yields: constantly improving data products
- Layer Improvements (3-6 man months)
  - goals: continual addition of high impact, useful layers to the system based on customer needs/requirements, create custom customer layers
  - yields: constantly improving data products
- Moogsoft Integration (1-2 man months)
  - goals: leverage work for Shell to produce a generic integration for Moogsoft customers
  - yields: another completed integration in the ITSM/ITOM space
- ServiceNow Integration (1-2 man months)
  - goals: leverage experience with KBR to produce a generic integration for ServiceNow customers
  - yields: another completed integration in the ITSM/ITOM space
- Investigate Integrations into Supply Chain Management Products
  - goals: investigate Oracle SCM, SAP Ariba, ...
  - yields: better combined solutions leveraging our extensive active and over two decades of historical data
- Investigate Integrations into Insurance Products
  - goals: investigate LexisNexis Risk Solutions, RMS, AIR Worldwide, ...
  - yields: better combined solutions leveraging our extensive active and over two decades of historical data
- Investigate Integrations into Airline Operations Products
  - goals: investigate GE Aviation Flight Operations, Sabre AirCentre, ...
  - yields: better combined solutions leverages our extensive active and predictive data
