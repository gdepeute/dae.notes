# Details of ABC and NewCo Process

- Dana had over $40M of preferred position debt in the company
- Bob negotiated for Dana to cram that down to $5M prefererence and 50% (from 60%) ownership (no voting rights, no board seat)
- Guess on current valuation $14-15M
- Sale would need to be ABOVE $9M (pre-ABC would have needed to be $45M+) for anyone else to make money
  - $5M preference to Dana
  - $4M to Ryan/SQN
- Was able to convince Dana as the company couldn't raise money with the fucked up cap table, everyone ran away

- ABC process (assignment for the benefit of creditors) is a process to re-launch the company
  - Company designates an assignee (Ravix for $50k fee) to find someone to buy the company
  - We give them ~10 possible targets
  - Management team would be one of the bids, basically accepting the $4M of SQN debt plus a $200k note to be paid back within a year
  - Other bids would need to exceed $4.2M to be considered
  - Need company set up so that current $ be transferred to NewCo, and receivables go there too
- ABC process HAS received shareholder and board approval
- NewCo structure
  - 50% management team
  - 50% Dana
  - Any investors coming in would get shares from equal part from management team AND Dana
  - All investor money to company, nothing to Dana
- Payroll
  - Tenefit employees will get next payroll from Tenefit
  - EStaff payroll delayed at least a week (awaiting receivables coming between the 15th and 21st)
  - Not enough $ to pay both
- Will need all employees to sign new employment deals with NewCo
- Proposed name "DisasterAWARE Enterprise" as the name of the new company

- Potentail Investors

  - Potential deal with Moshen helping to get investment from IQGeo (up to $1M)?
  - US Venture Partners
  - Bob "believes" he's got funded secure
  - It's not going to be large, the goal to get cash flow positive ASAP

- Current Receivables

  - $200-300k receivables, not enough to cover ALL payroll - $200k is here already, and in the bank allowing this payroll to go
  - $230k AllScripts receivable by 2/6.
  - $70k receivables coming in between 15th an 21st.

- PDC License

  - Will complete under NewCo, so awaiting until ABC is done

- Risks
  - ABC process to accept management team offer assuming no other higher offer
  - If ABC process is slow, might not be able to make estaff payroll, or NEXT employee payroll
  - Assuming ABC goes, MUST get funding to bridge us (along with receivables) to cash flow positive
