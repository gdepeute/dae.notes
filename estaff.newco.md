# Details of ABC and NewCo Process

- Dana had over $40M of preferred position debt in the company
- Bob negotiated for Dana to cram that down to $5M prefererence and 50% (from 60%) ownership (no voting rights, no board seat)
- Guess on current valuation $14-15M
- Sale would need to be ABOVE $9M (pre-ABC would have needed to be $45M+) for anyone else to make money
  - $5M preference to Dana
  - $4M to Ryan/SQN
- Was able to convince Dana as the company couldn't raise money with the fucked up cap table, everyone ran away

- ABC process (assignment for the benefit of creditors) is a process to re-launch the company
  - Company designates an assignee (Ravix for $50k fee) to find someone to buy the company
  - We give them ~10 possible targets
  - Management team would be one of the bids, basically accepting the $4M of SQN debt plus a $200k note to be paid back within a year
  - Other bids would need to exceed $4.2M to be considered
  - Need company set up so that current $ be transferred to NewCo, and receivables go there too
- ABC process HAS received shareholder and board approval
- NewCo structure
  - 50% management team
  - 50% Dana
  - Any investors coming in would get shares from equal part from management team AND Dana
  - All investor money to company, nothing to Dana
- Payroll
  - Tenefit employees will get next payroll from Tenefit
  - EStaff payroll delayed at least a week (awaiting receivables coming between the 15th and 21st)
  - Not enough $ to pay both
- Will need all employees to sign new employment deals with NewCo
- Proposed name "DisasterAWARE Enterprise" as the name of the new company

- Potentail Investors

  - Potential deal with Moshen helping to get investment from IQGeo (up to $1M)?
  - US Venture Partners
  - Bob "believes" he's got funded secure
  - It's not going to be large, the goal to get cash flow positive ASAP

- Current Receivables

  - $200-300k receivables, not enough to cover ALL payroll - $200k is here already, and in the bank allowing this payroll to go
  - $230k AllScripts receivable by 2/6.
  - $70k receivables coming in between 15th an 21st.

- PDC License

  - Will complete under NewCo, so awaiting until ABC is done

- Risks
  - ABC process to accept management team offer assuming no other higher offer
  - If ABC process is slow, might not be able to make estaff payroll, or NEXT employee payroll
  - Assuming ABC goes, MUST get funding to bridge us (along with receivables) to cash flow positive

# Notes from call with Erik A on 1/18/23

- $1M subordinate loan from Rosemary
- Arbitration to settle with Rosemary
- Erik A pissed off as Dana was taken care of in new deal, but no one else
- Bob explained it's not his style to screw people who have helped him...read is settle down and wait for ABC to settle
  - However Dana isn't going to willingly give up shares, so suspect they'll need to come out of management bucket
- Old cap table is a mess
- Dana strung the company along on promisory notes with 3x pref and 15% interest
- Get the sense Erik might file a lawsuit
- Bob put in $250k a while ago, $50k more recently, and another $200k last week or so, which is where the $4.2M (4M SQN plus 200k Bob) comes from in the post ABC world
- Erik was pissed off that only Dana was allowed to participate in the CNTP unwinding over the seized Russian oligarch - Victok Vekelsberg (sp?) which was .30 on the $ for the CNTP shares

# USVP Dry Run on 1/19/23

- Meeting with USVP is planned for 1/20/23 at 11:30am
- Notes on deck for dry-run

  - General comments:

    - Mixture of white and dark background feels unprofessional
    - Mixture of some slides with background images, and some not feels disjointed
    - Mixture of Roboto and Arial fonts inconsistent
    - Mixture of when BOLD is used and not isn't consistent
    - Color scheme inconsistency
    - Capitalization inconsistency
    - I "personally" see these as an "attention to detail" issue, and if it was code (i.e. inconsistent style) would be viewed very unfavorable
    - NO org chart???

  - Slide 4:
    - Would suggest changing the "Extensible" bullet to: "Extensible to include customer specific hazards and data"
  - Slide 11:
    - Search on "Risk Intelligence" hits on Everbridge and OnSolve ads
    - Search on "Risk intelligence driven operational resilience" hits on Onsolve
    - Might be useful to have a bullet or two as to WHY they ARE NOT the competition
  - Slide 12:
    - Using green checkmarks are bullets, only time we using them
  - Slide 15:

    - We say "Q4 **RECORD** 4 new logos", followed by **56** in 2023
    - Should briefly explain how - e.g. "Model proven, add X marketing and Y sales can easily hit that target"
    - Any other assumptions to hit that number which seems like a big stretch from a **record** of 4, means blowing that record out **every** quarter

  - Slide 20:
    - Why say "relatively" clean balance sheet, why not just say "clean"?
    - I'd put "new investors" ahead of employees and partners in the second bullet, after all that is the audience

## USVP prep/planning

- Bob's email 1/23 titles "Questions to think about"

  - You might be able to get US based floods from NWS and fires from local/regional and state fire agencies, but our proprietary solution is GLOBAL and based on Satellite imagery
  - Yes, it would appear IBM is investing heavily, and also has an asset focus
  - Yes, Google is working on a platform for floods and wildfires - Ray might be able to give us insight as to what they are doing
  - Faster than anyone else, we don't, but we are autoritative, not responding to social media or other unvalidated sources
  - Save lives and $$$ - Shell Oil example
  - Like most/like leasts? A Michelle question
  - High priority developments - Global floods and wildfires and other hazards over time
  - Team is 0...errr...13 people

- Ray's feedback
  - PDC's Mission is to improve and evolve the data in the system, and DIQ Mission is to development the commercial use cases around that data
  - Push the DATA angle
  - Floods - aggregation and combining to reduce noise of alerts
    - But if tracking "assets" why does the aggreagtion actually matter?
    - More about impact analysis
