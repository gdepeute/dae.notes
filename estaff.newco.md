# Details of ABC and NewCo Process

- Dana had over $40M of preferred position debt in the company
- Bob negotiated for Dana to cram that down to $5M prefererence and 50% (from 60%) ownership (no voting rights, no board seat)
- Guess on current valuation $14-15M
- Sale would need to be ABOVE $9M (pre-ABC would have needed to be $45M+) for anyone else to make money
  - $5M preference to Dana
  - $4M to Ryan/SQN
- Was able to convince Dana as the company couldn't raise money with the fucked up cap table, everyone ran away

- ABC process (assignment for the benefit of creditors) is a process to re-launch the company
  - Company designates an assignee (Ravix for $50k fee) to find someone to buy the company
  - We give them ~10 possible targets
  - Management team would be one of the bids, basically accepting the $4M of SQN debt plus a $200k note to be paid back within a year
  - Other bids would need to exceed $4.2M to be considered
  - Need company set up so that current $ be transferred to NewCo, and receivables go there too
- ABC process HAS received shareholder and board approval
- NewCo structure
  - 50% management team
  - 50% Dana
  - Any investors coming in would get shares from equal part from management team AND Dana
  - All investor money to company, nothing to Dana
- Payroll
  - Tenefit employees will get next payroll from Tenefit
  - EStaff payroll delayed at least a week (awaiting receivables coming between the 15th and 21st)
  - Not enough $ to pay both
- Will need all employees to sign new employment deals with NewCo
- Proposed name "DisasterAWARE Enterprise" as the name of the new company

- Potentail Investors

  - Potential deal with Moshen helping to get investment from IQGeo (up to $1M)?
  - US Venture Partners
  - Bob "believes" he's got funded secure
  - It's not going to be large, the goal to get cash flow positive ASAP

- Current Receivables

  - $200-300k receivables, not enough to cover ALL payroll - $200k is here already, and in the bank allowing this payroll to go
  - $230k AllScripts receivable by 2/6.
  - $70k receivables coming in between 15th an 21st.

- PDC License

  - Will complete under NewCo, so awaiting until ABC is done

- Risks
  - ABC process to accept management team offer assuming no other higher offer
  - If ABC process is slow, might not be able to make estaff payroll, or NEXT employee payroll
  - Assuming ABC goes, MUST get funding to bridge us (along with receivables) to cash flow positive

# Notes from call with Erik A on 1/18/23

- $1M subordinate loan from Rosemary
- Arbitration to settle with Rosemary
- Erik A pissed off as Dana was taken care of in new deal, but no one else
- Bob explained it's not his style to screw people who have helped him...read is settle down and wait for ABC to settle
  - However Dana isn't going to willingly give up shares, so suspect they'll need to come out of management bucket
- Old cap table is a mess
- Dana strung the company along on promisory notes with 3x pref and 15% interest
- Get the sense Erik might file a lawsuit
- Bob put in $250k a while ago, $50k more recently, and another $200k last week or so, which is where the $4.2M (4M SQN plus 200k Bob) comes from in the post ABC world
- Erik was pissed off that only Dana was allowed to participate in the CNTP unwinding over the seized Russian oligarch - Victok Vekelsberg (sp?) which was .30 on the $ for the CNTP shares

# USVP Dry Run on 1/19/23

- Meeting with USVP is planned for 1/20/23 at 11:30am
- Notes on deck for dry-run

  - General comments:

    - Mixture of white and dark background feels unprofessional
    - Mixture of some slides with background images, and some not feels disjointed
    - Mixture of Roboto and Arial fonts inconsistent
    - Mixture of when BOLD is used and not isn't consistent
    - Color scheme inconsistency
    - Capitalization inconsistency
    - I "personally" see these as an "attention to detail" issue, and if it was code (i.e. inconsistent style) would be viewed very unfavorable
    - NO org chart???

  - Slide 4:
    - Would suggest changing the "Extensible" bullet to: "Extensible to include customer specific hazards and data"
  - Slide 11:
    - Search on "Risk Intelligence" hits on Everbridge and OnSolve ads
    - Search on "Risk intelligence driven operational resilience" hits on Onsolve
    - Might be useful to have a bullet or two as to WHY they ARE NOT the competition
  - Slide 12:
    - Using green checkmarks are bullets, only time we using them
  - Slide 15:

    - We say "Q4 **RECORD** 4 new logos", followed by **56** in 2023
    - Should briefly explain how - e.g. "Model proven, add X marketing and Y sales can easily hit that target"
    - Any other assumptions to hit that number which seems like a big stretch from a **record** of 4, means blowing that record out **every** quarter

  - Slide 20:
    - Why say "relatively" clean balance sheet, why not just say "clean"?
    - I'd put "new investors" ahead of employees and partners in the second bullet, after all that is the audience

## USVP prep/planning

- Bob's email 1/23 titles "Questions to think about"

  - You might be able to get US based floods from NWS and fires from local/regional and state fire agencies, but our proprietary solution is GLOBAL and based on Satellite imagery
  - Yes, it would appear IBM is investing heavily, and also has an asset focus
  - Yes, Google is working on a platform for floods and wildfires - Ray might be able to give us insight as to what they are doing
  - Faster than anyone else, we don't, but we are autoritative, not responding to social media or other unvalidated sources
  - Save lives and $$$ - Shell Oil example
  - Like most/like leasts? A Michelle question
  - High priority developments - Global floods and wildfires and other hazards over time
  - Team is 0...errr...13 people

- Ray's feedback
  - PDC's Mission is to improve and evolve the data in the system, and DIQ Mission is to development the commercial use cases around that data
  - Push the DATA angle
  - Floods - aggregation and combining to reduce noise of alerts
    - But if tracking "assets" why does the aggreagtion actually matter?
    - More about impact analysis

## USVP Meeting - 1/23/23 3pm

- Steve
- Rick (no Rick, didn't show) / Defina (in conference room with Steve)
- Jacques (joined via Zoom)
- Questions
  - Product market fit
  - How the product is used
  - Where things are on the contract, exclusivity, ...
  - How it's different from publically available information, differentiation, where the $ comes from, ...
  -
  - Steve asking about all the Hurricane models out there vs. ours?
    - Bob suggests our is the best model
    - "Down to a couple of miles" when it gets close
  - Delfina asked about the largest customer and revenue
    - Wonders how big the marketsize is given Shell example ($300k/100 users)
    - Concerned that Shell isn't/won't be a $1M/year customer
    - ARR $710k at the moment
  - At slide 6 (post demo) at 3:50pm
  - Steve: Q1 bookings? $370k ARR
    - Funnel/Pipeline $900k
  - Jacques: Asked about AlertMedia/OnSolve and their $100M raises - what data they are using
  - Bob suggests we will sign more logos that EB, and they are targeting their existing 6000 critical comms customers...
  - Steve wants to go thru the "history" with Bob

## Current Situation 1/24/23

- Ryan/SQN believes there is an OnSolve deal on the table
- Ravix has told Bob an OnSolve offer is coming in Friday/Monday
- Is pushing Bob to NOT have our offer expire today
- We "technically" are not meant to be supporting customers at this point, but we are assuming this process is short and we can continue operation
- Bob has been funding payroll, but unclear how much longer will he do this AND estaff is at $2k/gross per pay period now.
- Note being sent to Ryan to inform him:
  - That Ravix "claims" there is an offer potentially coming in Friday/Monday
  - Forwarding the due-dilly list from OnSolve (many pages) to Ryan suggesting IF they come in with an offer, it will have a lot of conditions
  - That if payroll is not funded to answer the OnSolve questions and for customer support (that Ravix would pay us), Ravix will have no obligation but to tell customers they are no longer supported
  - AND that if the Amazon bill isn't paid, the service could be terminated at any time (not to mention, Ray could shut down the access to the data).
-

- Sent Executive Team chart to USVP

- ## [IQGeo Term Sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12L8gCbGBM9y0TGVgF_-AemcVYDTMCy3r3dLcxuA3K3o/edit)

- Conversation with Ryan
  - What does PDC have access to assets wise IF the Tenefit assets are sold to someone else?
  - Weren't we only a development arm of PDC, and joint ownership?
  - Tenefit assets are useless without the DATA
  -

## Ryan Proposal 1/25/23

- Wipe out 4M down to $500k
- Ryan would get 80% of all receivables those funds the business up to cap of $3.5M (Bob suggested $3M)
  - He was trying to get 80% of the 700k renewals for this year
- Ryan believes we have $3.5M new business in 2023
- Only existing customers, no NEW customers
  - Gateway AMR and DAE renewals and upsells
- He thinks we can raise $1M from IQgeo and $3M from USVP
  - Bob trying to explain "how do we survive in the mean time"
- Bob's proposal
  - Kicks in after investment of $Xm - Ryan doesn't agree to this
  - Allows existing renewals to fund the business
- Ryan suggest a restructuring of DIQ by reducing HC to be lean and mean to support the business and attack the new business
- Ryan doesn't care how and if we keep the lights on

## MDove thoughts

- Question: Do we have a viaable healthy business post capital raise?
  - Is the business viable?
  - Does the exclusivity of the PDC contract render ANY value, either in capital raise or sales?
    - Maybe capital raise, not in sales
- We STILL have no idea how to express the value of our DATA...the DATA is the key
  - Many prospects/customers say that public/free data is "good enough"
  - Examples: Hurricanes, Tornados, you aren't surprised by those, floods maybe (highest prevalence hazard on the planet)
- Confidence on 56 new logos (we are now starting down -1 this year) for this year
  - Pipeline plus current lead generation would never get us there
  - How does this change
- Make sure I get the Natalie projections that she's going to produce tonight

- Still want to know from Andrew whether we could just let this go away, and re-launch WITHOUT Ryan and WITHOUT Dana with partnership with PDC directly, unencumbered by all this...
- We could argue that ALL or MAJORITY of Development/DevOps was done against PDC development contracts
  - Exclusion would be any legacy Gateway/KWIC crap obviously
  - Potential Exceptions:
    - Asset Tracking POC - however could be argued this was done to shape the development contract
      - Would impact MB/Daimler
      - However ALL this code is in DisasterAWARE repos
    - Map service tools
    -
- Belief is the PDC agreement has
  - Joint ownership of all code developed on behalf of PDC
  - DevOps improvements done on PDC projects

## NewCo proposal back to Ryan - 1/26/23

- Cash projections

  - 80% of only legacy business - $508k (including the 80% of the AllScripts) - $623k
  - 60% of legacy, 20% of growth-19 - $446k
  - 60% of legacy, 20% 0f growth-19, 10% of new - $556k
  - thus 10% of new is $100k, 20% of growth-19 is $140k, leaving 60% of legacy at $306k

  60% - $406k - $100k = $306k
  20% - $140k - $100k = $40k
  10% - $210k - $100k = $110k

  - Any combination of these 3 + $100k to Ryan

  - Bob is going to accept Ryan's deal, but wants gentlemen agreement on the slide to remove the 10% on new business that USVP doesn't want that he'd remove to close the financing round

  ## USVP Meeting 1/27/23

  - Looks like they will invest $4M at $10M post - 40%
    - However they HATE the Ryan 10% of new business item
  - Dana would give up 20%, we would give up 20%
  - Leaves 30% for the company
  - Bob is gonna take 10%, and is expecting a 2 year vest and **full** acceleration on change of control
    - Bob suggested he will work 2 more years, then out
  - Leaves 15% for employees, 5% for new hires.
  - USVP needs
    - Cash flow assuming a revised Ryan deal
    - P&L assuming the revised Ryan deal
    - What the plan for stock options/cap table
  - Dana was expecting preferred stock out of this, leaving him with 30%
    - Needs lawyers to sort out how to not give Dana preferred
    - Worried he could block votes
    - Needs to NOT get his shares until USVP deal is done and stock allocated (in other words no vote)

## Stock Allocation

- 40% USVP
- 30% Dana
- 30% NewCo
  - 10% Bob
  - 15% for Employees
    - 10% for Executive team (5)
    - 5% for Employees (8)
- 3 vectors

  - Level
  - Performance
  - Years of Experience

- Payroll 1/27/23 still reduced pay
- Payroll restored going forward
- Back pay over 3 months (starting when???)
