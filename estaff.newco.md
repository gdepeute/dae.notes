# Details of ABC and NewCo Process

- Dana had over $40M of preferred position debt in the company
- Bob negotiated for Dana to cram that down to $5M prefererence and 50% (from 60%) ownership (no voting rights)
- Guess on current valuation $14-15M
- Sale would need to be ABOVE $9M (pre-ABC would have needed to be $45M+) for anyone else to make money
  - $5M preference to Dana
  - $4M to Ryan/SQN
- Was able to convince Dana as the company couldn't raise money with the fucked up cap table, everyone ran away

- ABC process (assignment for the benefit of creditors) is a process to re-launch the company
  - Company designates an assignee (Ravix for $50k fee) to find someone to buy the company
  - We give them ~10 possible targets
  - Management team would be one of the bids, basically accepting the $4M of SQN debt plus a $200k note
