# Current Jeremy priorities

ACTIVE:

1. Design an official letterhead that can be used for communication – DUE today 6/22
2. Updated Investor Deck for Andrew – DUE tomorrow 6/23

   - Initial update sent by Jeremy on 6/20 at 3:39pm PDT
   - Bob then requested chart with existing customers as well as IAEA slide (this has always been in our decks, did Jeremy not get the proper source deck originally)?
   - Bob pinged Jeremy for an update today, has the priority changed Bob? You noted in email that this could wait until tomorrow 6/23.

3. Disaster Report should be done end of this week
4. Email campaign work has been put on hold since Hubspot doesn’t support nurture campaigns. Next week we can migrate to a new platform. I will need a credit card number for Moosend and Webflow
5. Case study with Jeff should take a week, so hopefully by 7/1
6. New landing pages will need to be built but I should be able to get those done after the 4th of July if we get the other systems set-up
7. Rework ad campaigns should only take a couple days, but I am going to work on the - Disaster report above all else.
8. Create some short demo videos for use in email and other campaigns
