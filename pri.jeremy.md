# Current Jeremy priorities

ACTIVE:

1. Design an official letterhead that can be used for communication – DUE today 6/22
2. Updated Investor Deck for Andrew – DUE tomorrow 6/23

- Initial update sent by Jeremy on 6/20 at 3:39pm PDT
- Bob then requested chart with existing customers as well as IAEA slide (this has always been in our decks, did Jeremy not get the proper source deck originally)?
- Bob pinged Jeremy for an update today, has the priority changed Bob? You noted in email that this could wait until tomorrow 6/23.
- Bob just shared 5/16/23 investor deck on 6/22 at 9:18am
- Disaster Report should be done end of this week
- Email campaign work has been put on hold since Hubspot doesn’t support nurture campaigns. Next week we can migrate to a new platform. I will need a credit card number for Moosend and Webflow
- Case study with Jeff should take a week, so hopefully by 7/1
- New landing pages will need to be built but I should be able to get those done after the 4th of July if we get the other systems set-up
- Rework ad campaigns should only take a couple days, but I am going to work on the - Disaster report above all else.
- Create some short demo videos for use in email and other campaigns

COMPLETED:

- Blurbs for us to be able to send out to PDC leads and Trial users – DONE 6/20
  - All DAE leads sent blurb, and all trial users since 6/1 been sent blurb – DONE 6/21
