- 1/17/23 - Business discussion with Christian Wirth

  - Happy with the demo/presentation, and what are next steps
  - Localization requirements likely
  - Desires confidence on the customer end???
  - He now wants to check with his customer base to see if this is a use case they want/desire
  - Christian closed the deal (Nessig - System Integrator, subsidiary of NEC) he was after in Japan
    - Using Nessig for implementation, Christian doing larger sales, they will do smaller sales to smaller cities/governments
    - Nessig has done pre-investment into IQgeo
    - Needs to sort out with Nessig what data "they" are interested in
    - Sell digital platform service for their customers - smaller cities/governments
    - Requested dedicated sales for in Japan
    - They have a couple of the largest power companies in Japan
  - Bob tossed out potential for exclusivity in Japan in this marketplace

    - Bob told the story of the processor built for the Newton via exclusivity for NEC to go into Atari and other game consoles "back in the day..."

  - Christian had to change his license model for Nessig/Japan
    - Allow them to buy perpetual licenses and pay for support
    - They pre-bought a large number of perpetual licenses, and support
    - Christian will get regular reports on the # of licenses being used
    - 5 year business case to justify the investment
    - IQgeo business model has been standard subscription
    - Next meeting is in mid-February in Japan
    - Pre-sold them 2820 licenses, he thinks this is a LOW number, but they need to sell to justify the Nessig customer base
    - They sold 4000 licenses to one company alone (Tepco)
    - "Add-on" license
    - They've designed in upside license flexibility in emergency situations for short period of time (e.g. 1 month). Uses as upsell opportunity.
    - He likes the solution, however unclear what's needed/desired for their Japanese customers
    - Would like to give access to Nessig and his Japanese sales guys (trial) to begin to understand it and to do Japanese demo (localization)
  - He's like to get Nessig trials, but how long are we comfortable them understanding the data?

  - Bob asked for (non-binding) "term sheet" in order to use for fundraising. They hit cash flow positive this past year. Even if pricing TBD.

  - Will need Japanese localization
