  - Christian had to change his license model for Nessig/Japan
    - Allow them to buy perpetual licenses and pay for support
    - They pre-bought a large number of perpetual licenses, and support
    - Christian will get regular reports on the # of licenses being used

    - They sold 4000 licenses to one company alone
    - "Add-on" license
    - They've designed in upside license flexibility in emergency situations for short period of time (e.g. 1 month). Uses as upsell opportunity.

    - Would like to give access to Nessig and his Japanese sales guys (trial) to begin to understand it and to do Japanese demo (localization)
