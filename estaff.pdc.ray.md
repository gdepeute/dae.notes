# Discussion with Ray on 6/1/23

- No immediate funcing available
- Confidences on UFERS is high
  - Provide some relief until the end of the year
- Ray's question - Do we have enough bandwidth to do all this
- Can use "extreme accounting measures" if needed
- Ray doesn't control when those funds are released
- Asset Protection work is still pending
  - Funds do disappear in September
  - That works really needs to be done by September to get follow-on
- Doesn't want to jeopardize the PDC in this process
- Ray suggests tackling the map engine effort, which goes against what Johnny proposed
  - Kontour has made changes to the open source mapping efforts
  - Doesn't have full funding for this effort (yet)
  - Skillset to make it happen - Johnny/Thomas
  - Ray feels Johnny/Thomas plate is full
  - 1400 hours over 8-9 months - enough bandwidth to do it???
  - This is 35 man weeks, or 17-18 weeks for Johnny/Thomas
- UFERS going a different route that prior years
  - Goes via Janice (?), much more restrictive and require more documentation
- Two remaining projects
  - Asset protection
  - Push notification / mobile location tracking
- UFERS, pushing for deadlines in 12 months (term of UFER) + 1 year (if he can't get then he'd take 6 months)
- Ray's thoughts, having discussions on his side
  - Simplifying the application
  - Remove unused/less used features
  - Remove/review data layers
  - Map engine swap
  - Wants sister to be able to use the application (heinous - goes against what our customers need)
  - Trying to find workarounds to add new features because the foundation was done wrong
  - Flood combining was done to address a UI limitation (noise/filtering)
  - "Reimagine" the application - FFS
  - A lot of what's on Johnny's list, he believes that we need to reimagine in a simplified app.
    - For example, separate hazard type layers in his mind is like the floods, dealing with a UI issue (too much noise)
  - Suggest heat maps would be something we might work on
- Ray has a discretionary pool of $ he's built up over the years for "emergencies"
