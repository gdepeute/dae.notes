# Discussion with Ray on 6/1/23

- No immediate funcing available
- Confidences on UFERS is high
  - Provide some relief until the end of the year
- Ray's question - Do we have enough bandwidth to do all this
- Can use "extreme accounting measures" if needed
- Ray doesn't control when those funds are released
- Asset Protection work is still pending
  - Funds do disappear in September
  - That works really needs to be done by September to get follow-on
- Doesn't want to jeopardize the PDC in this process
- Ray suggests tackling the map engine effort, which goes against what Johnny proposed
  - Kontour has made changes to the open source mapping efforts
  - Doesn't have full funding for this effort (yet)
  - Skillset to make it happen - Johnny/Thomas
  - Ray feels Johnny/Thomas plate is full
  - 1400 hours over 8-9 months - enough bandwidth to do it???
  - This is 35 man weeks, or 17-18 weeks for Johnny/Thomas
- UFERS going a different route that prior years
  - Goes via Janice (?), much more restrictive and require more documentation
