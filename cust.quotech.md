## OliverWyman

- Been working with Quotech, and been evaluating the system (DAE)
- They are a DaaS opportunity, and had a set of questions for us:
  - Can we POST an asset lat/long or set of assets with lat/long to an API and receive a response which lists the active hazards and their MAGs that apply to only those assets? (versus the entire global list of hazards)
  - In the above, can we tweak the radius from event epicentre to reduce the MAG of a hazard?
  - Is there an API to register for email notifications for client specific areas/regions/assets versus the entire set of global hazards?
  - If so, can we customise email notifications: subject line / body / from address?
