# Quotech and associated customers Marsh/OliverWyman/...

## OliverWyman

- Been working with Quotech, and been evaluating the system (DAE)
- They are a DaaS opportunity, and had a set of questions for us:
  - Can we POST an asset lat/long or set of assets with lat/long to an API and receive a response which lists the active hazards and their MAGs that apply to only those assets? (versus the entire global list of hazards)
  - In the above, can we tweak the radius from event epicentre to reduce the MAG of a hazard?
  - Is there an API to register for email notifications for client specific areas/regions/assets versus the entire set of global hazards?
  - If so, can we customise email notifications: subject line / body / from address?

### Call with Guillaume - 3/21/23

- Real-time use case is the speculation, active hazards
- OliverWyman wants this to be pro-bono
- Meeting on Thursday to discuss how to move them to do the "work" on their side
  - Going to push them to pay for the POC
  - We "might" offer sample code
  - Doesn't look like they are interested in Historical Hazards
