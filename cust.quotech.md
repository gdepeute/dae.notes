## OliverWyman

- Been working with Quotech, and been evaluating the system (DAE)
- They are a DaaS opportunity, and had a set of questions for us:
  - Can we POST an asset lat/long or set of assets with lat/long to an API and receive a response which lists the active hazards and their MAGs that apply to only those assets? (versus the entire global list of hazards)
  - In the above, can we tweak the radius from event epicentre to reduce the MAG of a hazard?
  - Is there an API to register for email notifications for client specific areas/regions/assets versus the entire set of global hazards?
  - If so, can we customise email notifications: subject line / body / from address?

### Call with Guillaume - 3/21/23

- Real-time use case is the speculation, active hazards
- OliverWyman wants this to be pro-bono
- Meeting on Thursday to discuss how to move them to do the "work" on their side
  - Going to push them to pay for the POC
  - We "might" offer sample code
  - Doesn't look like they are interested in Historical Hazards

### Call with Marsh/OliverWyman/Quotech discussion

- Lance Daniels / OliverWyman - Principal in Munich Office
- Jack Watt / Marsh - Global Finance Sustainability in London
- Working to build MVP for 5-ish customers
  - Building a platform?
  - Sending alerts (email/other), working with those customers to build out the requirements
  - Speaking few months for starting to build
  - Pilot starting now thru June/July (5 total pilots planned)
    - Ideally would like to use live data, but they are suggesting it's up to us whether to extend the trial OR send sample data OR ...
    - Expect to have testable/usable product (MVP) by the end of the pilot
  - Hard to give idea of "reach" for the data (in terms of # of users), but they have a better understanding of # of assets.
  - Thinking 1000's of customers
- Extend the trials for a week?
