# Meeting with Kaushik 8/1/23

- Crisis investment space re-charged, new team
- New member - Baldwin
- New responsibility, requires new reporting
- Three areas
  - Crisis response product - more efficient and effective and economical
  - Work closely World Metorlogical Association (WMO) on early warning system worldwide
    - Skepticism internally about tech companies working with government organizations
    - WMO is working with everyone in the tech sector to try and solve this early warning problem
  - Meticulous about measurement for reporting
- Requests
  - Baldwin was lead on the private instance and getting that rolled over
  - Johnny mentioned he would be happy to "customize" their private instance
  - Example: spam of alerts from floods, time consuming and problematic
    - Would like to do some changes to floods and wildfires to reduce the noise
    - Initially training might be useful, but clearly they'd like parameter changes
