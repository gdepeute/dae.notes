# Meeting with Kaushik 8/1/23

- Crisis investment space re-charged, new team
- New member - Baldwin
- New responsibility, requires new reporting
- Three areas
  - Crisis response product - more efficient and effective and economical
  - Work closely World Metorlogical Association (WMO) on early warning system worldwide
    - Skepticism internally about tech companies working with government organizations
    - WMO is working with everyone in the tech sector to try and solve this early warning problem
  - Meticulous about measurement for reporting
- Requests

  - Baldwin was lead on the private instance and getting that rolled over
  - Johnny mentioned he would be happy to "customize" their private instance
  - Example: spam of alerts from floods, time consuming and problematic

    - Would like to do some changes to floods and wildfires to reduce the noise
    - Initially training might be useful, but clearly they'd like parameter changes
    - Predictive/model alerting they are seeing in the system
      - They'd like to flag these separately/differently
      - Simple explanation: Actual hazards vs. Predictive hazards
      - API ingestion workflow need
    - Four types of flood hazards
      - NWS floods which we try to collpase
      - Nasa floods / satellite imagery - more predictive/modelled
      - Manual hazards
      - Landslides could fall into the same category, like Nasa wildfires
    - Can they add additional thresholds on top of all hazards, including predictive. They like/want predictive for early warning, but just too noisy, like to apply a "higher threshold" to process them (or not)

    - They want to start using DAE more into their stepper workflow
    - They believe the data is rich, but rarely used in their ops workflow
    - They can't use the DAE pane of glass
    - Want some layers access to API so they can use to visualize
      - Example: base layer map, next layer base layer plus wind speed, next layer base layers + wind + ...
    - Kaushik will set up a meeting to review this with the right folks and ...

- Kaushik would like to hear about new features/functionality/...
  - Feels like he wants something f2f, partner advisory council, ...
  - Wants something more proactive/f2f/asking questions/...
- Checked on aalani@fb.com in the analytics, expected.
