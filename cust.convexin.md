# Convexin

- James and Dean
  - WOuld like to use it "post-event"
  - Catastrophe optimization group
  - Risk management/accumulations
  - Where are fixed assets located/value/...
  - As close to love as possible
  - Gomatch, as close to "rooftop"
  - Various tools to deal with risk
  - Shapes seemingly more focused to humanitarian response
  - Post event (event happened) - come up with quantification range of loss outcomes based on fixed asset locations, overlay wind speed/direction,
  - Along DAE said, use aerial imagery from GEOIC consoritum
  - Loves DAE as early warning system
  - Tornado needs to be smaller swath - needs to be much more granular
  - Hotspots layer for Wildfire
  - Feels like boundaries are drawn to focus on response/people not assets
  - Tornado/Wildfire/Floods - least modeled and least data
  - Actual wind speed data to best determine damaage
  - Man-made is important as well / damage footprint
  - Civil unrest/Terrorism/Bombs
- Two ways to think about each problem
  - Shapefile to describe loss
  - And what percentage lost they might have
  - Does PDC have data on insurance take-up rates in an area
  - Have a chat with GEOIC - insurance consortiun - aerial imagery
- Would like to visuize in one place
- Not post-event, relative hazard scores?
  - Past events focus first
  - Probability/likely frequency (historical data)
- Recent tornado feedback
- Question on the data available
- Spoke to Michelle
- Would like
