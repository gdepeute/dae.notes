# EStaff 1/9/23

- Russell @ Daimler

  - Clock skew issue, generating lots of analytic messages
  - Ping Adam on their side, he suggested Russell's skew was only 40 seconds
  - Had Thomas improve the analytic to only produce if > 1:45 and to include time of skew
  - Will clean up #dae-users-errors

- Patch 7.3.14-442

  - Patch completed on Sunday by Thomas, to be deployed by Arnaldo (when?)

- IQgeo call

  - We saw Matt's demo
  - Offered to produce latest data for his meeting with higher ups
  - He said he would let me know

- Shell call

  - Bit of a dud
  - No one showed up, all actions still in their court
  - Frustrating...

- Review of 7.4 and readiness happening this afternoon
