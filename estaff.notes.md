# EStaff 1/12/23

- Russell @ Daimler
  - Adam responded to me yesterday, DID find configuration issue, since fixed, should no longer see time skew

# EStaff 1/9/23

- Russell @ Daimler

  - Clock skew issue, generating lots of analytic messages
  - Ping Adam on their side, he suggested Russell's skew was only 40 seconds
  - Had Thomas improve the analytic to only produce if > 1:45 and to include time of skew
  - Will clean up #dae-users-errors

- Patch 7.3.14-442

  - Patch completed on Sunday by Thomas, to be deployed by Arnaldo (when?)

- IQgeo call

  - We saw Matt's demo
  - Offered to produce latest data for his meeting with higher ups
  - He said he would let me know

- Shell call

  - Bit of a dud
  - No one showed up, all actions still in their court
  - Frustrating...

- Review of 7.4 and readiness happening this afternoon

- Live Updates

  - ABC process - received shareholder and board approacl
  - Assign all assets to assignee - we give list of 10 companies to sell the comapny to
  - We are putting in a bid as the management organization (assume SQN debt $4M, 200k promisory note paid back in a year)
    - Hence our offer is effectively $4.2M
    - Any other competitive offer would need to exceed the $4.2M to even be considered
  - Have money for next payroll, but not the one at the end of the month
  - Who are the other 10 companies
  - Will pay Tenefit payroll this week as scheduled the employees out of Tenefit, NewCo would pay the estaff
  - Will need new employment contracts with NewCo
  - 50% ownership NewCo, 50% Dana - new stock issued equally from NewCo/Dana
  - Ravix is the assignee we just paid $50k to in order to try and sell the company
  - PDC license may NOT go with one of the other companies
  - Moshen helping to get the deal with IQgeo completed into NewCo
  - Payroll for Tenefit will be a bridge loan to NewCo
  - "Believes" he has funding committed for NewCo, but should know before payroll date
  - Trying to get IQgeo to invest in NewCo at up to $1M
  - Potential deal with USVP, asking for customer references, and talk to Ray
  - $200-300k receivables, not enough to cover ALL payroll
  - $230k AllScripts receivable by 2/6.
  - $70k receivables coming in between 15th an 21st.
  - Asking EStaff to delay payroll by one week so we can get commitment, unclear how 1 week commitment can be made as the $ to cover it isn't there
  - Complete the PDC license AFTER the ABC is complete

  - Friday meeting with Ray - took him thru the investor deck
  - Discussed the ABC process, claims he was knodding/smiling - perhaps this is simply getting Dana out of our hair
