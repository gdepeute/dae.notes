# EStaff 1/9/23

- Russell @ Daimler

  - Clock skew issue, generating lots of analytic messages
  - Ping Adam on their side, he suggested Russell's skew was only 40 seconds
  - Had Thomas improve the analytic to only produce if > 1:45 and to include time of skew
  - Will clean up #dae-users-errors

- Patch
