Unclear what they are requesting here. We have some Rainfall accumulation layers, and some animated forecast and potential layers. BUT there are also a bunch of the Rainfall layers are TAOS layers. Need to clarify what exactly they want and that TAOS is off the table.

This yields this set of map services to be proxied - initial experiment using API gateway:
