# Notification Support

- Assertion is, one of the first things a company buys in the GSOC team is a mass notification system
  - They need a solution to get notifications/messages out to employees, customers, ...
  - Appears this is typically a standalone platform, meaning, when I have a reason to send a notification, I go to the mass notifications system, enter the message, then select who it should go to
  - Appears that typically geo-positioning information is not used in many cases as there is no mechanism to easily get geolocations from the individuals
    - Mass notification systems have API support to upload geolocation data, and could use it if they have it.

## What does this mean for us?

- Add improved notification support to DAE.
- Any user that is using DisasterAWARE app on their phone could opt in to sharing their geolocation on a regular basis (typically when there is a large change in location - 100ft or more)
- DAE could use that data as mapped to hazards to alert those users that might be in harms way/directly impacted
