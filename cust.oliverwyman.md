# Marsh checkin 5/2/23 - 7am

- Jack Watt / Lead
- Mitchell Fry
- Henry Stroud

- Need to understand usage of the data to determine pricing
- API flow from us to their product
  - How often it's refreshed is open
- They would do matching to locations they are interested in
- That would then be viewed by customers in their application
- Fetch data once, and then distribute it into the different customer instances
- How are they selling the product?
- They are on a product journey they are on
- Working with 5 pilot customers (for free) over the next few months
- Beta toward the end of the year
- Launch all of next year (100's?)
- Looking for a ballpark figure ($50k) to understand what the final agreement might look like
